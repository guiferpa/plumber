## The motivation
I am a brazilian [Git](https://git-scm.com) user and when watched a video about Git of [Jonathan Lima](https://github.com/greenboxal) named ["Deep into Git"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2j7e81J798) I thinked will be very good idea create the basic commands of Git for study a technology that I used in everytime of my programmer life. However I want rewrite the porcelain layer of the Git and by consequence learn more about it.
